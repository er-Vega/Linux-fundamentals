# Linux-fundamentals
This repository contains small Bash scripts created to practice Linux fundamentals and basic automation.  The scripts included here are learning exercises and are not intended to be production-ready tools. The goal of this repository is to document my hands-on learning process with Linux and Bash scripting.
